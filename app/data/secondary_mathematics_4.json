            "Solve: 𝑥2 − 24 = 0",
            "Some quadratic equations do not have real-number solutions because we need to find the square root of a negative number.",
            "Example 1",
            "Solve: 𝑛2 = −4",

            "Remember, the square root of a negative number is not a real number. An expanded number system, called the complex number system, has been devised to give meaning to expressions such as √−4 and √−23.",
            "‌Complex numbers",
            "Complex numbers are numbers that consist of two parts — a real number and an imaginary number. Complex numbers are the building blocks of more intricate mathematics, such as algebra. They can be applied to many aspects of real life, especially in electronics and electromagnetism.",
            "The standard format for complex numbers is a + bi, with the real number first and the imaginary number last. 𝑖 is defined as the square root of -1.",
            "Because either part could be 0, any real number is also a complex number. Complex does not mean complicated; it means that the two types of numbers combine to form a complex, like a housing complex — a group of buildings joined together.",
            "Real numbers are tangible values that can be plotted on a horizontal number line, such as fractions, integers or any number that you can think of. Imaginary numbers are abstract concepts that are used when you need the square root of a negative number.",
            "The complex number system is an algebraic extension of the ordinary real numbers by the imaginary number i.",
            "If 𝑖 = √−1",

            "‌The Argand Diagram",
            "We know that a real number can be represented as a point on a number line. By contrast, a complex number is represented as a point in a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis of the coordinate plane is called the real axis. The vertical axis is called the imaginary axis. The coordinate system is called the complex plane.",
            "Every complex number corresponds to a point in the complex plane and every point in the complex plane corresponds to a complex number. When we represent a complex number as a point in the complex plane, we say that we are plotting the complex number.",
            "It is very useful to have a graphical or pictorial representation of complex numbers. For example, the complex number z = 3+ 4i is represented as a point in the xy plane with coordinates (3,4) as shown in Figure 1. That is, the real part, 3, is plotted on the x axis, and the imaginary part, 4, is plotted on the y axis.",
            "More generally, the complex number z = a + ib is plotted as a point with coordinates (a,b) as shown in Figure 2.",
            "Because the real part of z is plotted on the horizontal axis we often refer to this as the real axis. The imaginary part of z is plotted on the vertical axis and so we refer to this as the imaginary axis. Such a diagram is called an Argand diagram. Engineers often refer to this diagram as the complex plane.",
            "Plot the complex numbers z1 = 2 + 3i, z2 = −3 + 2i, z3 = −3 − 2i, z4 = 2 − 5i, z5 = 6, z6 = i on an Argand diagram.",

            "The Argand diagram is shown in Figure 3.",
            "Note that purely real numbers lie on the real axis. Purely imaginary numbers lie on the imaginary axis.",
            "Another observation is that complex conjugate pairs (such as −3 + 2𝑖 and −3 − 2𝑖) lie symmetrically about the x axis.",
            "Finally, because every real number, a say, can be written as a complex number, a + 0𝑖, that is as a complex number with a zero imaginary part, it follows that all real numbers are also complex numbers. As such we see that complex numbers form an extension of the sets of numbers with which we were already familiar. Consider the complex plane below.",

            "Conjugates of complex numbers",
            "Every complex number has associated with it another complex number known as its complex conjugate. You find the complex conjugate simply by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number.",
            "To find the complex conjugate of 1 − 3𝑖 we change the sign of the imaginary part. Thus the complex conjugate of 1 − 3𝑖 is 1 + 3𝑖.",
            "Example 3",
            "To find the complex conjugate of −4 − 3𝑖 we change the sign of the imaginary part. Thus the complex conjugate of −4 − 3𝑖 is −4 + 3𝑖.",
            "‌Operations on complex numbers",
            "Basics of Complex Numbers",
            "Complex numbers are created when you combine an imaginary number with a real number. This is often defined in its most basic form as 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 with “a” representing the real number and “b” the imaginary amount. In order to fully understand the basics of a complex number you need to look at the first rule of complex numbers with solving a problem such as this:",
            "6 – 3𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖",
            "The answer is very straightforward as it highlights the main concept of complex numbers that they can only be of equal value if the imaginary and real number are the same. Therefore the solution to this problem is that 6 = 𝑥 and −3 = 𝑦.",
            "A slightly simplified but useful way to think of operations using complex numbers is that they are treated in a similar way to binomials, so like terms are combined to get to the answer. This applies when adding, subtracting and multiplying complex numbers and just requires that you remember to combine the imaginary and real parts separately.",
            "‌Adding & Subtracting complex numbers",
            "Because a complex number is a binomial — a numerical expression with two terms — arithmetic is generally done in the same way as any binomial, by combining the like terms and simplifying. For example:",

            "Area is the amount of space (on the inside) that a shape has. Imagine that you have a rectangle and a lot of one-inch squares cut out of construction paper. The number of one-inch squares it takes to completely cover the rectangle with no gaps or overlaps is the area of the rectangle. If it took 42 of those one-inch squares to cover the rectangle, that rectangle would have an area of 42 square inches. Area is always measured in square units, such as square inches, square centimeters, square feet, etc. It is also written as 42 sq. inches, or 42 in².",

            "To find the area of a shape, you could cover it with a lot of squares and then count, but that takes a lot of time. There is a quicker way. Formulas allow you to find the area of common shapes quickly. All you have to do is take a couple of measurements and do some computations. Many times the measurements will have been given to you, making it even easier. One of the simplest formulas is the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle (A) is length (l) multiplied by width (w). If you know the length and width of the rectangle, you multiply the two together to get the area. Other common shapes are often related so can be derived from one another, rather than memorizing lots formulae.",

Find the area of all of the smaller shapes and then add your areas together.",
            "At times, you are finding the area of an irregular shape that appears to be a shape inside of another shape. In this case, you are taking away some area. You would subtract the excess area of the inside the outside shape from the area of the outside shape.",
