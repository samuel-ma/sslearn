Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book Prevention Act and the Sati Act aim to prevent widow burning Indeed, China assistance to families with girls, India is not only encouraging female dowry Meanwhile, China has taken strides to limit the abuse of modern technology by outlawing the use of ultrasound or gender detection methods Moreover, they have granted parents who have a female child another chance at birthing a son in the hopes that families will not abandon, abort or murder their female infant inequality_b_1417535.html) In groups Answer the questions below 1 inequality as you understand it from the article 2 Discuss different measures that have been taken by different countries to tackle gender inequality Individually 1 Sex-selection is a violation of the right to life (a) Explain the statement above (b) Identify the statistics from the story which clearly shows how the violation of the above right is violated in different countries 2 Gender inequality exists in different countries around the world Compare the situation in South Sudan to that in other countries citing relevant examples from the story Read the extract below From what you learn, answer questions 3 and 4 Gender inequality exists in South Sudan and it negatively affects women more than their male counterparts Women, who constitute 49% of the population, are in most cases marginalised in social and economic spheres and, therefore, are unable to contribute effectively to social, economic and 19 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book political development The SSDP in its broad outline recognises that there is a high correlation between poverty, social vulnerability and gender inequality Strongly related to the poverty, social vulnerability and gender inequality is the low literacy level among women, estimated at 70% (NBHS, 2009) This state of affairs is a key determinant of gender inequality in South Sudan The ratio of girls to boys in primary school had shifted slightly in the past few years, evidently attributable to the Government of South Sudan's political will to promote gender equality and empower women by putting the right policies in place, enacting the relevant laws where they are required, and by designing the right strategies and programmes on the education of the girl child in particular As a consequence, the ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education has been rising Factors that force girls out of school include late starts in education, as well as family and cultural responsibilities because girls are more likely than boys to assume roles of providing home care and support for relatives that are aged or sick This implies that the elimination of gender disparities remains a challenge at secondary school level This might also be the case at tertiary education level Therefore, there is a need to formulate strategies that target family and cultural tendencies with a view to eliminating them altogether The Government of the Republic of South Sudan (RSS) adopted a national plan for action on Combating Gender-Based Violence (C/GBV) because gender- based violence was commonly practised Following this plan of action, it adopted a national policy on women empowerment and the national policy for girl's education in 2007; as well as the national strategy on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in 2008 The adoption of the quota system in the general election law of 2008, which guaranteed 25% of the total number of seats for women in the legislative assemblies, in addition to earlier policies constituted the necessary evidence of the then existing political will to empower women in Southern Sudan This has led to more seats held by women, though male Parliamentarians, Governors and Undersecretaries still outnumber women There is a need to accelerate progress on this front South_Sudan:MDG_Goal_3:_Promote_gender_equality_and_empower_ women) 3 Discuss any ways that the South Sudan government has made strides to ensure gender inequality is eliminated in the country 4 Do you think the government can do more?

To have equal rights and equal pay, that should really be our aim Men, gender inequality is your issue too Although you may not agree, am afraid it's true You should have the right to express your emotions and be what you please You should not be pulled back by stigma, but instead be who you are at ease and make this journey a joint endeavour We are of equal value if we only open our eyes At the heart of change is where we become most wise Now or never?

Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book the news of my death will be received I can imagine so many things while I am alive and writing I won't be able to imagine anything when I am dead, because I don't know whether dead people are capable of imagination, though our religion teaches us that there is life after death I do know as I write these last words in my life that my death will cause a great breasts Breasts that have suckled eleven children She will undo her long, beautiful hair and pull it apart She will shout and ask what she has done to God that she should deserve such punishment She will call my name countless times and she will ask why God should deprive her of her eldest run about, crying and shouting, and many women will chase her and try to console her Some will say that it is the wish of God, Allah, the Almighty, that I die She will never believe that I took my own life voluntarily No, she will never believe it because suicide is uncommon in our community Poor mother, I know how she will feel As for Baba (father), one can never be sure how he will react In our society, men are not supposed to weep It is a sign of weakness In any case, none of us ever saw Baba cry He is such a hard-hearted man He will feel sad, very sad Then I know he will grab his prayer beads And his peers, some of the neighbours, will come and sit by him and say exactly what Baba is saying But Baba will not weep He believes so much in his manhood, his religion and God and the total submission of women to men and their parents He will say I died because it is the will of Allah, the Greatest He will tell people to hurry and bury me before it is too late So the whole community will be busy People will assemble in and around our house, talking about me and my I know how you my sisters will react to the news of my death You will cry like Mama Your eyes will be red and they will bulge I know how Intuma will sing while weeping She will say she has lost her eldest sister She will ask Muslim girl to get a university education and then to have gone to the white community As for Amina, she will just gnash her teeth She will probably go into a trance It will take her a long time to believe She will believe days later, after my funeral; otherwise she will think I will come back to life After a while, she will say to herself that she must stop crying That it is God's will Isha will take over from her She will say that someone killed her sister. 28 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book She will cry for a long time In the end, she will lose her voice and her speech will be incomprehensible for some time As for Ajaratu, she will leave the compound and run towards the stream Then people will chase her for fear she might drown herself or do some other harm to herself I know how all of you, my sisters, will react As for our brothers, they are no different from Baba and all our uncles But I think that the little boys will cry They will all cry because they will remember what I used to do for all of them at the end of Ramadan month and on Christmas They will miss the presents that I used to work so hard to get for them just to make them happy The older brothers will probably hate me for killing myself They will never stop to think, to understand and appreciate why I did what I did But that is their business, they are all just like Baba, full of their manhood The dailies will have various captions I can imagine such headlines as, 'Dr say, 'Suicide, Dr Dao dead' Some papers will suspect foul play until the facts are known But that is what should be expected It is normal In the hospital where I work, my colleagues and my patients will react likewise Many of my colleagues have always said that I am too reserved for their comfort Some think it is because I am a Muslim Some think that it is because I am in a profession which is traditionally male I never told them the I can imagine how Ya-Yanoh will feel Remember sisters, I always tell you about Ya-Yanoh, the woman with a big ulcer on her left thigh In her village they say that her ulcer is incurable because she is said to be a witch She also believes that and has become very miserable She is insulted by all and sundry and her situation is made worse by the fact that she is childless When I admitted her, she narrated her ordeal to me and I told her I would help her to get well She could not believe it At the time of writing this letter, she is in the process of getting discharged Her sore is healed, completely I remember when I used to go on my rounds in the wards She was my favourite patient I treated her like our mother She told me I had restored her dignity and people will regard her as a human being Before that she was treated with contempt and opprobrium Sometimes, after listening to her stories, I felt like crying She is a nice woman after all One thing I remember about her is her teeth They are very clean and almost intact Because of this also, she said people accused her of 29 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book witchcraft According to people in her village, she said, a woman of her age ought to have few teeth So her life was one full of torment How she will cry when news of my death reaches her Amina and Ajara will recall the lady who said that I am the only female doctor she ever knew and how happy that made her She used to say that even if she died, she would have had the satisfaction of having known a female doctor She was joking, of course I like her all the same She is one of my favourites She appreciates the fact that we work hard and make lots of that had she been a doctor she would not have liked night duty because she wants to be with her husband Then she would laugh and the other patients would join in her laughter She is such fun She too will cry and feel very sad My dear sisters, I know that you will want to know why I took my life Well, it is a long story Partly, I am doing it for your sakes I did it so that you can daughters and your daughters' daughters You may not understand now However, as you read along, as you get to the end of this letter, I am sure you will understand and appreciate my action You may not approve of this method of helping you to be free, to be women of dignity, pride and self-esteem I am writing this unusual letter to justify my action to be free I hope I am also helping women of my community If I fail to tell you the reason for my action, some of you will never forgive me This is why I am writing the story of my life to you, my younger sisters I owe it to you as a moral duty, to tell you the truth, nothing but the truth From the time I was a little child, Baba was always concerned about upholding the family name of the Daos The upholding of the family name transcends everything in Baba's life The respectability and reverence which the name Dao enjoys should never be allowed to diminish But from the time I can remember things correctly, it had appeared that the upholding of the family name was the sole responsibility of us girls The fact that our great grandfather was among the few Imams of the mosque of Fullah Town has served to enslave us rather than make us free people You know how people talk about us We should not say certain things because we are of the Dao family The things that normal people do we cannot do We are a very religious family But above all we are women; so we hold the family name in trust record time, before our brothers – both the elder and the younger ones We always did better than they did Baba, as you all know, was against our going 30 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book to school to get Western education He was more inclined to allow the boys rather than us His argument was the usual and familiar one, to which our uncles, apart from one, also subscribe Girls should get married and have children Western education, he had observed, bred immorality, disrespect Uncle Bubu is the most educated and enlightened of them all That he went to school was an accident of history So he knows what education means We all thanked him for what he did for us But that was a long time ago In school we did better than all our brothers Even the eldest never reached my standard We all know how Nkodo Shaifu, from our own point of view, brought dishonour to this family He had had children out of wedlock Baba was not offended He was happy he had grandchildren Worst of all, Nkodo had had these children while still at school He could not pass his examinations to go to college That, to me, is a shame Baba never thought it was dishonourable It was Uncle Bardara who felt somewhat embarrassed by the incident Do you still recall our big secret? No one, as far as I know, can forget that incident I am referring to the time Ajara almost died while trying to induce an had been made pregnant out of wedlock, it would have brought dishonour to the Dao family Ajara almost lost her life I hope all of you are beginning to understand what I am trying to point out to you Have we not lamented many times that we are not allowed out of the house except when accompanied by several of our younger brothers? You know that we must always come home much earlier than even our younger brothers You also know how we are watched Our friends are even chosen for us That applied to me too as an elder sister That was how I found myself the centre of ridicule, because by the time I went to college I did not know how to dance learned to dance much later in life when I was in England studying medicine I was afraid of men, because I was afraid they would ask me out to parties I must confess that I was miserable Have you girls noticed how our younger brothers can dance to all sorts of music? Baba would only say with delight that they are men You all remember the incident when Baba threatened to disown me I am referring to the day I wore trousers I had just come from England and thought I had grown out of that type of family control Baba said it was a big shame, a dishonour to the family for a girl, his daughter, to put on trousers 'This 31 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book was why I said that Western education breeds immorality You have come here now to teach your own younger sisters bad manners God have mercy said, will also consume mother According to him, hell was not comparable he ever saw me in trousers again I always damn that day when I think of it It was a terrible day Mother wept later for me Poor mother, she weeps for everything I felt guilty as though I had committed a crime I always thought women could wear trousers in Islamic countries Baba said I was to dress like a woman He meant perhaps for me to tie a wrappa To tie a wrappa, and to do work, I thought Whenever I looked into my wardrobe and glanced at my beautiful trousers, I felt pain in my stomach The thought that I could never put them on while I was under the regime of Baba made me feel sick Home has become hell for me No boyfriend would dare call me or come to our house When I had intimated to Baba that the government had provided me with a house, he told me I would leave his house only on my way to my matrimonial home I wept bitterly Mother wept too For Baba, unmarried girls should not live by themselves It is immoral But it is all right for our brothers to live by themselves That would not bring dishonour to the family My God! So I accepted in disbelief 'Why then did I have to spend so much of my time going to college?' I asked myself I would have been like our mother Mama accepted and believed that she was born to serve Baba or any man that would have her as a wife Mama could never question anything Baba said to her, good or bad Mama, scolded her that she was giving him a bad name by staying slim Baba likes fat women So Mama became fat I once told her that from a professional point of view her fat would kill her I meant it She laughed and ignored me 'If you disobey your husband, you will not go to heaven.' She was sure and very serious about it I laughed and Mama thought I was stupid You all remember when we wanted to talk to Uncle Bardara We wanted to talk to him so that he could talk to his brother to allow us freedom of movement, also We saw him beat his wives very often for minor offences One day he beat one of his wives until the woman vomited Her crime had been that she 32 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book had gone to watch masquerade devils For Uncle Bardara, it was the devil that had induced his wife So he had decided to beat the hell out of her, as our people would say In many ways, Uncle Bardara is like Baba Many people also like Baba because he is said to be very religious He knows the Koran and quotes from it with ease, which has earned him the envy of his peers He has visited the Holy City of Mecca several times and this also adds to the reverence people have for him He looks like someone incapable of My world then became a prison, a closed world Sometimes I feel guilty even just talking to men I feel my father's curse will affect me I have contemplated rebellion many times But again, I have been taught that an outright act of rebellion against any of one's parents is sinful I am afraid Do you remember when our elder brother searched my wardrobe after money and inadvertently came across a letter from a boyfriend of mine? You remember how he read my letter and reported the matter to Baba? You know that his emphasis was on these sentences: 'I got attracted to you because of your brown eyes, beautifully framed features and exquisitely contoured body which makes men stare at you when you walk You are also as brilliant as you are beautiful.' He was vexed He had already assumed the role of Baba Can all of you imagine? Our lives would be regimented from morning to evening I know as well as you do that Nkodo will be a worse tyrant than Baba What then is our future? Amina, that question is for you Of all my sisters, it is you who will say that, despite my feelings, I should not have taken the action I have taken Maybe you are right Well, wait until you get to be my age Wait letter, your view will support mine I really hope so I do not want to feel that the action I am taking will have been in vain I hope you feel that life is worth living and not something you should endure You can only be of use to yourself and to mankind if you are free I mean if you are free to move, to associate, to talk, to feel inner harmony and a sense of worth That is exactly what we have not been able to achieve and family members Unknown to me, they agreed that I should marry the son head teacher at the Islamic school He is even older than our elder brother He has two wives I am supposed to be wife number three, because we are all Muslims Baba said he comes from a noble family Their great grandfather was also among the few who became Imam of Fullah Town Mosque These 33 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book are all the considerations Mama unfortunately is in favour, because she has no choice Yes, I am to marry to Alhaji Hamsu's son, the fat man As fat as a bundle Fat and clumsy He has created around him an aura of innocent vulnerability Perhaps that is why Baba likes him as a husband for me But despite this deception, like our Uncle Bardara, he beats his wives and children with I know that Amina and Aisha would laugh at this You will think it is a big joke without consulting me So I asked myself whether I was born never to make a choice, never to enjoy freedom, never to be happy Now I am to move to another house of exile, to serve a worse master, to be enslaved again To say no would be to bring dishonour to the family To accept is to compromise my freedom So what is my choice? If I had told mother that I would not accept such a proposal, she would have ordered me to repeat 'ASTERFULAI' seven times, because I am not supposed to refuse whatever my father proposes or wishes, even as an adult I do not know what is good for me Women do not know what is good for them Imagine any of you, my sisters, being a wife of Alhaji Hamsu's eldest son Our mother married Baba because, in their time, their own concept of marriage was different from ours Things have changed, you know We should not be standing still while others are moving Everybody has a right to be happy, to be free, to love someone of his or her choice, irrespective of family name or religion It is because of these considerations that I have decided not to enter into such a relationship, organised by Baba and others I have decided not to move from one prison Kingdom of Heaven, I am prepared to explain myself to Allah the Greatest I am sure there is justice and freedom in Heaven The time I have set for myself is near, the time for my departure I know that death is painful Many have died before me in this world because they believed in a cause Many more will die for ideas and principles they believe in As you know, sisters, for me the world has been a rugged terrain for most of my life I hope that as a result of my action you will in time enjoy the softer terrain of this world Do not despair, but do not be complacent either The moment is coming nearer The minutes are moving faster I am now coming to the end of my letter The room is hot There is a breeze but not enough to make the place cool As usual, I can smell some of the concoctions in Baba's room He is probably awake, making all sorts of things for his numerous clients Or maybe he is awake, praying He could also be just reading his Koran The smell from his room is very fresh. 34 English Secondary 4 - Unit 1: Gender Issues Pupil Book Mother is fast asleep I am sure she hopes to see me in the morning She will come to wake me up She will come to say, 'N'damba my daughter, are you not going to work today?' Then I will reply, 'No, Mama, today is my day off.'
